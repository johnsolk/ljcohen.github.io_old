I am a Ph.D. student in physiology at UC Davis. My research in comparative environmental genomics and bioinformatics focuses on how diverse organisms use their unique genomic codes to respond to changes in their environments. With the recent explosion in nucleic acid sequencing biotechnology, I am passionate about demystifying data-intensive phases of research so that discoveries can be proportional to the data collected then translated at decision-making levels: patient care, environmental resource management and policy.
