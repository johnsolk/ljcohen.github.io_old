I am a Ph.D. student in physiology at UC Davis with over ten years of combined research experience in the field, lab, and bioinformatics. In line with August Krogh's principle that each organism has a unique physiology valuable for studying, my research focuses on how organisms use their unique genomic codes to respond to changes in their environments. Responses can be measured at the transcript and protein levels producing large (GB-TB) - often overwhelming, but exciting! - volumes of data to be analyzed. With the recent explosion in nucleic acid sequencing biotechnology, I am passionate about demystifying data-intensive phases of research so that discoveries can be proportional to the amount of data collected, then translated into the appropriate decision-making levels: patient care, environmental resource management and policy.
